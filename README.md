Practice &amp; code projects from SoloLearn.

* My First Code Coach!
  * Let's code for real! The given program should output the text: "My first C# Code Coach!". But something is wrong.

* Social network
  * You are making a social network application and want to add post creation functionality. As a user creates a post, the text "New post" should be automatically outputted so that then the user can add the text he/she wants to share. The program you are given declares a Post class with a text private field, and the ShowPost() method which outputs the content.
  * Complete the class with
    * a constructor, which outputs "New post" as called,
    * Text property, which will allow you to get and set the value of the text field.
  * Once you have made the changes to the program so that it works correctly, then in main, the program will take the text of the post from the user, create a post object, assign the taken value to the text field and output it.

* Solve The Puzzle
  * A game machine has 5 games installed on it. Write a program to take N number as input and output the corresponding game with N index from the array. If user enters an invalid number that is out of array range, the program should output "Invalid number".

* Only The Evens!
  * The program you are given takes 5 numbers as input and stores them in an array. Complete the program to go through the array and output the the sum of even numbers.

* Array To Table
  * Complete the program to output this array in the form of a table (without separation):
    * 123
    * 456
    * 789

* Qualifying For The Olympics
  * The qualifiers for the Olympiad lasts 3 days, and one winner is selected each qualifying day. The jagged array you are given represents the list of all participants, divided by the number of days (there are 3 arrays inside the main one, each representing the participants who took part on that day). Write a program to take the numbers of each day's winners as input and output them.
